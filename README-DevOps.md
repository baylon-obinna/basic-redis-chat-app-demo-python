# Implementing DevOps practices on the Redis chat application

The main goal of this project is to implement DevOps practices in the Redis chat application. 
DevOps practices include the following:

- Creating Docker files
- Containerization
- Continuous Integration (CI)
- Continuous Deployment (CD)

Creating Dockerfiles
The Dockerfile is used to build a Docker image. The Docker images contains the redis chat application services frontend and backend packaged with there dependencies. The Docker images is then used to create Docker containers.

Containerization
Containerization is the process of packaging an application and its dependencies into a container. The container is then run on a container platform such as Docker. Containerization allows you to run the application in a consistent environment, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.

Docker compose is used to spin up Docker containers from the Docker file created above, with necessary configuration for each services including the Redis database

Commands to build the Docker container:

docker compose build

Command to run the Docker container:

docker compose up

Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of automating the integration of code changes into a shared repository. CI helps to catch bugs early in the development process and ensures that the code is always in a deployable state.

We will use GitHub Actions to implement CI for the Go web application. GitHub Actions is a feature of GitHub that allows you to automate workflows, such as building, testing, and deploying code.

The GitHub Actions workflow will run the following steps:

- Checkout the code from the repository
- Build the Docker image
- Run tests
- Push the images to a docker hub repository
- Update the values of the helm charts with new image tags

Continuous Deployment (CD)

Continuous Deployment (CD) is the practice of automatically deploying code changes to a production environment. CD helps to reduce the time between code changes and deployment, allowing you to deliver new features and fixes to users faster.

We will use Argo CD to implement CD for the Redis chat application. Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It allows you to deploy applications to Kubernetes clusters using Git as the source of truth.

The Argo CD application will deploy the Go web application to a Kubernetes cluster. The application will be automatically synced with the Git repository, ensuring that the application is always up to date.
